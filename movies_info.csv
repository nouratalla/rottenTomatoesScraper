Hero,2002,94,Yimou Zhang,"Jet Li, Tony Leung Chiu Wai, Maggie Cheung, Donnie Yen","With death-defying action sequences and epic historic sweep, Hero offers everything a martial arts fan could ask for."
Road House,1989,41,Rowdy Herrington,"Patrick Swayze, Kelly Lynch, Sam Elliott, Ben Gazzara",Whether Road House is simply bad or so bad it's good depends largely on the audience's fondness for Swayze -- and tolerance for violently cheesy action.
Unstoppable,2010,87,Tony Scott,"Denzel Washington, Chris Pine, Rosario Dawson, Kevin Dunn","As fast, loud, and relentless as the train at the center of the story, Unstoppable is perfect popcorn entertainment -- and director Tony Scott's best movie in years."

Die Hard 2,1990,70,Renny Harlin,"Bruce Willis, Bonnie Bedelia, William Atherton, Reginald VelJohnson","It lacks the fresh thrills of its predecessor, but Die Hard 2 still works as an over-the-top -- and reasonably taut -- big-budget sequel, with plenty of set pieces to paper over the plot deficiencies."

The Protector,2005,53,Prachya Pinkaew,"Tony Jaa, Johnny Nguyen, Nathan Jones, Phetthai Vongkumlao","Despite some impressive fight scenes, this trimmed-down version of the Thai action pic is an off-putting mix of scant plot, choppy editing, and confusing subtitles and dubbing."
Revenge,2017,93,Coralie Fargeat,"Matilda Anna Ingrid Lutz, Kevin Janssens, Vincent Colombe, Guillaume Bouchède","Revenge slices and dices genre tropes, working within an exploitation framework while adding a timely -- yet never less than viscerally thrilling -- feminist spin."
El Mariachi,1992,91,Robert Rodriguez,"Carlos Gallardo, Consuelo Gómez, Reinol Martinez, Peter Marquardt","Made on a shoestring budget, El Mariachi's story is not new. However, the movie has so much energy that it's thoroughly enjoyable."

Top Gun,1986,58,Tony Scott,"Tom Cruise, Kelly McGillis, Anthony Edwards, Val Kilmer","Though it features some of the most memorable and electrifying aereial footage shot with an expert eye for action, Top Gun offers too little for non-adolescent viewers to chew on when its characters aren't in the air."
Con Air,1997,58,Simon West,"Nicolas Cage, John Cusack, John Malkovich, Steve Buscemi","Con Air won't win any awards for believability - and all involved seem cheerfully aware of it, making some of this blockbuster action outing's biggest flaws fairly easy to forgive."

The Mummy,1999,60,Stephen Sommers,"Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo","It's difficult to make a persuasive argument for The Mummy as any kind of meaningful cinematic achievement, but it's undeniably fun to watch."
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,2005,59,Doug Liman,"Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, Vince Vaughn, Adam Brody","Although this action-romance suffers from weak writing and one too many explosions, the chemistry generated by onscreen couple Pitt and Jolie is palpable enough to make this a thoroughly enjoyable summer action flick."
Rush Hour,1998,62,Brett Ratner,"Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker, Tom Wilkinson, Elizabeth Peña","While it won't win any awards for originality, the combustible chemistry between its stars means Rush Hour hits just as hard on either side of the action-comedy divide."
The Equalizer,2014,60,Antoine Fuqua,"Denzel Washington, Marton Csokas, Chloë Grace Moretz, David Harbour","The Equalizer is more stylishly violent than meaningful, but with Antoine Fuqua behind the cameras and Denzel Washington dispensing justice, it delivers."
Captain America: Civil War,2016,90,Anthony Russo,"Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Sebastian Stan",Captain America: Civil War begins the next wave of Marvel movies with an action-packed superhero blockbuster boasting a decidedly non-cartoonish plot and the courage to explore thought-provoking themes.

Bloodsport,1988,46,Newt Arnold,"Jean-Claude Van Damme, Donald Gibb, Leah Ayres, Norman Burton","This is where it all began for the Muscles from Brussels, but beyond Van Damme's athleticism, Bloodsport is a cliched, virtually plotless exercise in action movie recycling."
Blade,1998,57,Stephen Norrington,"Wesley Snipes, Stephen Dorff, Kris Kristofferson, N'Bushe Wright","Though some may find the plot a bit lacking, Blade's action is fierce, plentiful, and appropriately stylish for a comic book adaptation."
Bad Boys,1995,43,Michael Bay,"Martin Lawrence, Will Smith, Téa Leoni, Tchéky Karyo","Bad Boys stars Will Smith and Martin Lawrence have enjoyable chemistry; unfortunately, director Michael Bay too often drowns it out with set pieces and explosions in place of an actual story."
Die Hard With a Vengeance,1995,58,John McTiernan,"Bruce Willis, Jeremy Irons, Samuel L. Jackson, Graham Greene","Die Hard with a Vengeance benefits from Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson's barbed interplay, but clatters to a bombastic finish in a vain effort to cover for an overall lack of fresh ideas."

Under Siege,1992,79,Andrew Davis,"Steven Seagal, Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Busey, Erika Eleniak","A well-directed action thriller that makes the most of its confined setting, Under Siege marks a high point for early '90s action -- and its star's spotty filmography."

Cliffhanger,1993,68,Renny Harlin,"Sylvester Stallone, John Lithgow, Michael Rooker, Janine Turner","While it can't escape comparisons to the movies it borrows from, Cliffhanger is a tense, action-packed thriller and a showcase for the talents that made Sylvester Stallone a star."
Marvel's the Avengers,2012,91,Joss Whedon,"Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth","Thanks to a script that emphasizes its heroes' humanity and a wealth of superpowered set pieces, The Avengers lives up to its hype and raises the bar for Marvel at the movies."
Hot Fuzz,2007,91,Edgar Wright,"Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Jim Broadbent, Paddy Considine",The brilliant minds behind Shaun of the Dead successfully take a shot at the buddy cop genre with Hot Fuzz. The result is a bitingly satiric and hugely entertaining parody.

Heat,1995,88,Michael Mann,"Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer, Jon Voight","Though Al Pacino and Robert De Niro share but a handful of screen minutes together, Heat is an engrossing crime drama that draws compelling performances from its stars -- and confirms Michael Mann's mastery of the genre."
